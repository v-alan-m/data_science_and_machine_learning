    "### Supervised learning\n",
    "- When the data is labelled data and we're trying to predict a label, based off a known feature\n",
    "    - Trained using labeled data, with a known output\n",
    "        - E.g Output data is labeled either **F** (fails), **R** (runs)\n",
    "- The learning algorithm recieves a set of imputs with the correct outputs\n",
    "    - The algo comapares the actual output with the correct outputs, to find errors\n",
    "    - It then modifies the model, accordingly\n",
    "- For training the algo is feed labeled data, then it is tested with unlabeled date  \n",

    "-  When the data is unlabelled and we're trying to group together similar data points, based off features\n",

    "- Explore the data for patterns\n",
    "- Popular techniques:\n",
    "    - Self-organizing maps\n",
    "    - Nearest-neighbour mapping\n",

    "- Creating an algorithm to perform an action from experience\n",
    "- Used heavily in robotics, gaming and navigation\n",
    "- The algo discovers which actions yeild the highest value through trail and error\n",
    "- This type of learning has 3 main concepts:\n",
    "    - Agent - the learner\n",
    "    - Environment = everything the agent interacts with\n",
    "    - Actions - What the agent can do \n",
    "- The agent chooses actions that maximise the expected reward over time\n",
    "    - The policy will determine the rate of reward \n",
    "- The goal is to learn the best policy"
